# Classify Alzheimer’s disease by vision transformer
## Main Purpose
This project aims to implement a vision transformer to Classify Alzheimer’s disease and have a minimum accuracy of 0.8 on the test set. I am sorry that I did not achieve this goal and the code of this project may have some problems. In this document, I will describe the structure of the model and the parts that have been implemented.
