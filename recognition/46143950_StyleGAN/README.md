## How to train your own images?
### Before training
A few parameters have to be specified in `config.py`.

| Variable            | Description                                                 | Example
| -------------       | -------------                                               |------------- 
| CHANNELS            | Number of channels of training images.                      | 1
| LDIM                | Dimension of latent vectors.                                | 128
| SRES                | Starting resolution, 4 or 8 suggested.                      | 4
| TRES                | Target resolution, must be the power of 2.                  | 256
| BSIZE               | Batch size of each resolution training.                     | (32, 32, 32, 32, 16, 8, 4)
| FILTERS             | Number of filters of each resolution.                       | (256, 256, 256, 256, 128, 64, 32)
| STAB                | Whether to stabilize-train the model after fade-in.         | False
| EPOCHS              | Number of epochs to train for each resolution.              | {0:50, 1:(40,10), 2:(40,10), 3:(40,10), 4:(40,20), 5:(40,20), 6:(40,20)}
| INPUT_IMAGE_FOLDER  | Folder of training images.                                  | D:\ADNI_AD_NC_2D
| NSAMPLES            | Number of images to generate when training.                 | 25
| OUT_ROOT            | Root folder that contains training outputs.                 | D:\output

> **Note** `OUT_ROOT` folder must not exist before training. Training process will create `OUT_ROOT` folder and its 4 sub-folders as below,
 - **ckpts** for saving checkpoints
 - **images** for saving progressive images
 - **log** for saving los loss files
 - **models** for saving model plots

### Start training
Training can be run by simply nevigating to the project root folder and executing **`python train.py`**.

### During training
`NSAMPLES` sample images will be generated after each epoch under the folder `IMAGE_DIR` as configured in `config.py`. 4 model plots, fade-in discrimator, stabilized discriminator, fade-in generator, stabilized generator will be generated in `MODEL_DIR` for each resolution training. Weights will be saved in `CKPTS_DIR` after each resolution training.

### After training
Two csv files, dloss.csv and gloss.csv, of log of training loss will be generated in `LOG_DIR`, from which plots can be generated.

## The Model
My model is based on [<ins>Progressive Growing GAN</ins>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196), where each resolution is trained before a higher resolution block fades in (see [<ins>here</ins>](https://github.com/KaiatUQ/StyleGAN/blob/e7d4111eae9fadbe16f9431b2524d6f1093f9627/modules.py#L152)). Most of architecture follows the [<ins>StyleGAN</ins>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948) paper with minor variations.

### Overall Structure
The structure of the model is given below.

<p align="center">
    <kbd><img src="asset/StyleGAN_Structure.jpg" width="450"></kbd>
</p>

A few points to note,

 - latent vector **z** is passed through fully connected layers to generate **w** (see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L184) and [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L213)).
 - **w** is transformed and injected 2 times in each resolution block (see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L127) and [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L133)).
 - number of fully connected layers is 8, **w** and **z** have the same dimension.
 - input of 'Synthesis network' is constant (see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L177)).
 - a noise vector **B** is injected 2 times in each resolution block (see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L125) and see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L131)).
 - layer 'AdaIN' takes 2 inputs, result of conv3x3 + noise **B** and a style vector **A** (see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L125) and see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L131)).
 - used loss function [<ins>Wasserstein Distance</ins>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) for gradient stability (see [<ins>here</ins>](modules.py#L196)).
 - model is trained progressively.

### Model Variations
Original paper aims to generate photo realistic images of resolution 1024 x 1024. The dimension of image in my training datasets is much smaller (256 x 256 appox.) and is in grayscale so my model is a simplified version (in terms of training configurations, not model structure) of StyleGAN, to avoid unnecessary complication, which saves training time.

|                             | My Model           | Original       | Justification
| -------------               | -------------      |-------------   |------------- 
| Dimension of latent vector  | 200                | 512            | Original model trains 1024x1024 images, mine 256x256, reduced for simplification.
| Image channel               | 1                  | 3              | The training images are in grayscale.
| Target resolution           | 256x256            | 1024x1024      | The training images are in 256x256 or similar scale.
| Number of filters           | 256, ..., 32       | 512, ..., 32   | Reduced unnecessary complexity.
| Number of FC layers         | 6                  | 8              | Reduced unnecessary complexity.

## A Training Example

Below is one of training trials in my experiment. Out of the three datasets, the OASIS is the easiest to train, but the model is also the easiest to collapse in contrast AKOA is relatively difficult to train since the trianing images are quite noisy.

### Settings
 - starting resolution: 4x4.
 - target resolution: 256x256.
 - latent vector dimemsion: 200.
 - batch size: 16, 16, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4.
 - epochs: 10, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15.
 - training images: 4800 from data set.
 - model not stabilized after fade in.

### Loss plot
Both discriminator and generator converged well in the low resolution blocks, but fluctuated at high resolution blocks. Most significant suddent changes in loss were observed when model grew, as highlighted in below plot.

## How to play with `predict.py`?
Once trained, `predict.py` can be used to load trained models and generate above images by running **`python predict.py`**. It supports two types of image generations, nxn random images and bilinear interpolation as shown above. Make sure below parameters are properly configured before running the command. 

When the program finishes running, the generated images can be found in the specified folder.

> **Note** make sure the same parameters are used as how model is trained, especially the target resolution has to match. Keep all `.py` files under the same folder, as other files are dependencies of `predict.py`.

```
# PARAMETERS TO SET
output_res = (256, 256)          # output resolution of generated images
n = 9                            # number of samples to generate, squre of an integer
steps = 10                       # steps of interpolation
ckpt = r'path of ckpts'          # path of checkpoint files, ex: r'D:\ckpts\OASIS.ckpt'
folder = r'path to save images'  # path of folder the generated images to be saved
```
